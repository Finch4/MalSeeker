# MalSeeker
Helps you find: phising, live hosted, cloud hosted [Like mega.nz ] Websites/Malware.

## Versions

The first version is developed with the API SerpWow, the code is more clear, the downside of this version is that you need to pay monthly for the requests.
The second version is developed with Selenium, the downsides are: slower and you need to leave the chromedriver open until it finishes to scrape.

## Network Connection Map
This feature is available only for the second version, seen the monthly cost at the moment, at the end of the scraping you need to go to: 127.0.0.1:8050 to view the map, here an example:
